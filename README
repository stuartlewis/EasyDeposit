Welcome to the EasyDeposit PHP client!
--------------------------------------
Version: 0.1

The EasyDeposit client is a PHP powered configurable SWORD repository deposit
client. The client can be easily configured to allow you to create a custom
deposit interface for your repository. 'Steps' can be added or removed from
the client to tailor it to your own requirements, new custom steps can be
easily created, and the look and feel of the client can be easily changed
by editing the CSS and header and footer files.

The client was originally written by Stuart Lewis (stuart@stuartlewis.com) at
The University of Auckland Library.
